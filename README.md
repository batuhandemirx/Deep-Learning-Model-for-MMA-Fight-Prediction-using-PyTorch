# Deep-Learning-Model-for-MMA-Fight-Prediction-using-PyTorch
Developed a deep learning classifier using PyTorch to predict UFC fight outcomes,  Achieved ~70% test accuracy by optimizing a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture with Dropout regularization and implementing a custom inference pipeline for new matchmaking scenarios.
